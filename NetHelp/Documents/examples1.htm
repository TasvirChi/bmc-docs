<h4>Examples</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>In a MediaSpace based media portal</b>:</p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpFirst" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 37.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; tab-stops: 37.7pt"><span style="COLOR: #666560"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span></span>A video that is published in a few private channels but also in at 
least one public gallery (Content Privacy = No Restriction) will be visible to 
everyone with access to the portal.  Access to this video in this case is 
available to all from the public gallery page itself, via the portal’s Global 
Search or via a direct link to the MediaSpace page of this 
video.      </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 37.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18.6pt; tab-stops: 37.7pt"><span style="COLOR: #666560"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">•</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; VISIBILITY: hidden">      
</span></span>A video that is published in a few private channels but also in 
<u>at least one</u> organizational shared gallery (Content Privacy = Requires 
Authentication), will be visible to all members of the organization (following 
login to the portal) from the organizational shared gallery page itself, but 
also via the portal’s Global Search or via a direct link to the MediaSpace page 
of this video. This content will not be available to anonymous viewers with a 
direct link to the MediaSpace page of this video - a login page will be prompted 
in this case.  </p>

</span></span>A video that is published in a few private channels but is also 
set in Kaltura categories managed in the KMC account that are not integrated 
with the media portal (for example, categories integrated with Kaltura 
extensions to CMS/LMS, categories set by the account KMC administrator for 
different purposes, etc.). Access to the video via the Media Portal is 
determined only by the entitlements settings of the categories the Media Portal 
is integrated with. This is controlled by the application specific “privacy 
content” label set to these categories.</p>
